**365 days on canvas**, is a project where I spent 20 minutes every day
on the `<canvas>` tag. More about it [here](/2012/05/365-days-on-canvas/).

<script type="text/javascript" src="/projects/365-days-on-canvas/js/loader.js"></script>

<!-- Octopress removes the style if not wrapped -->
<div><style type="text/css">
    canvas {
        border : 1px solid #ccc;
    }
</style></div>

Day 1
-----
Let's start simple! Only `strokeRect()` and `lineTo()` calls.

Squareman is born:

<canvas id="day1" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
Day 2
-----
Squareman feels alone and wants me to draw some friends.
I added *color*, *lineWidth* and *scale* options.

Meet the team:

<canvas id="day2" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
Day 3
-----
Now that they are three and there's color, our friends feel like partying!

**Click on the canvas to start/stop the animation:**

<canvas id="day3" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
Days 4/5
-----
I don't know what drinks they serve at the party but our friends start
seeing some weird rotating stuff.

This one was tricky and 20 minutes were not enough.
From now on, all canvases are animated and
**you can start/stop the animation with a click.**

<canvas id="day4-5" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
Day 6
-----
StickMan now has a *bounding box* so that collisions are better.

<canvas id="day6" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
Day 7
-----
What the hell is that?

<canvas id="day7" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

Yes, it's a beach. It's ugly, I know, don't mention it.
But guess what?! It will get *much* better next week so don't forget
to come back!

**There will be a shark!**
