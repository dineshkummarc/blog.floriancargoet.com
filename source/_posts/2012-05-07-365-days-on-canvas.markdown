Another long term project! This one will last, you guessed it, one year. 

No, that's not true, I will probably give up in a few weeks.
I've tried [taking photographs everyday](http://365phonephotographs.tumblr.com)
 but I stopped at 80.
I've tried writing everyday ([750 Words](http://750words.com/)) 
and it lasted only 11 days.

So, I'm bad at projects that require that I work on them everyday.
Should I stop? Hell, no!

What's 365 days on canvas?
--------------------------

I'm sure you get the "365 days" part so let's focus on the canvas part.
`<canvas>` is an HTML tag that allows you to draw with JavaScript code.
You can draw shapes, lines, text and other images. If you redraw the 
canvas several times per second, you have an animation. That's what I'll 
be doing in this project. I'll be drawing stuff and animating it.
Probably interactive animated stuff. 

There is no goal. I will work on my canvas every day, twenty minutes a day.
I'll post weekly updates, with the work of the seven previous days.
At some point, hopefully before the end of the year, I'll build some app
that will allow you to browse easily all these canvases and all this code.

I won't have 365 great ideas so I encourage you to tell me in the comments
where you want this project to go. 

365 * (1 idea + 20 minutes) == guaranted fun!
