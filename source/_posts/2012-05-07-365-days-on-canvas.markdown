Another long term project! This one will last, you guessed it, one year. 

No, that's not true, I will probably give up in a few weeks.
I've tried [taking photographs everyday](http://365phonephotographs.tumblr.com)
 but I stopped at 80.
I've tried writing everyday ([750 Words](http://750words.com/)) 
and it lasted only 11 days.

So, I'm bad at projects that require that I work on them everyday.
Should I stop? Hell, no!

What's 365 days on canvas?
--------------------------

I'm sure you get the "365 days" part so let's focus on the canvas part.
`<canvas>` is an HTML tag that allows you to draw with JavaScript code.
