**365 days on canvas**, is a project where I spent 20 minutes every day
on the `<canvas>` tag. More about it [here](/2012/05/365-days-on-canvas/).

Here is the work of the last 7 days.

<script type="text/javascript" src="/projects/365-days-on-canvas/js/loader.js"></script>

<!-- Octopress removes the style if not wrapped -->
<div><style type="text/css">
    div.entry-content canvas {
        border : 1px solid #ccc;
        position : relative;
    }
    div.entry-content button {
        display : block;
    }
</style></div>
